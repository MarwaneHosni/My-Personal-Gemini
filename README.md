# Gemini AI Replica with React

Welcome to the **Gemini AI Replica** repository! This project gives you the tools to build your own Gemini-like large language model (LLM) interface using React. Explore the world of LLMs and create an engaging user experience that lets you interact with them seamlessly.

## Live Demo

## Key Features

- **Text-Based Interaction:** Easily interact with a simulated LLM through a simple and intuitive text interface.
- **Google Gemini API Integration (Optional):** Connect to Googleâ€™s Gemini API for real-time LLM interaction (requires API access).
- **Highly Customizable:** Customize both the UI and functionality to meet your specific needs.

## Project Structure

- **Components:** All React components are located in the `src/components` folder.
- **Assets:** Static files, like images and styles, are stored in the `src/assets` folder.
- **Utilities:** Utility functions and helper code are found in the `src/utils` folder.

## Key Points

- The project is built with React to handle the interface.
- The code is organized for clarity, maintainability, and ease of use.
- Building an LLM interface with this project gives you a hands-on way to learn about both LLMs and React development.
- You need to create an ".env" file and provide your personal API.

## Documentation & Resources

- **Google Gemini API Docs (Optional):** If you're planning to integrate with the Google Gemini API, you can refer to the [Google Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/tutorial?lang=web) for detailed instructions.
